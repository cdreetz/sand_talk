## What is sand talk?

<b> The Summary </b>
- A seamless way to get answers and have conversations with GPT with minimal phone use, by minimizing the need to navigate, type, and read from 
your phone.  

<b> The Story </b>
- Often I find myself in deep thought and internal question asking during walks outside or while pacing inside. While these are often the moments
of when I develop a deeper understanding of things I may have learned before but hadn't thought about it from a particular perspective, a reoccuring
theme during these deep thought states is I think of the right questions to ask about concepts or ideas that push my understanding forward.  The 
problem with this scenario is the questions I want answers to, force me to pull out my phone and navigate to a browser, type in my question, try 
try to find an article, then proceed to read the article, all while being outside, likely in the heat, in the bright sun where it makes seeing 
and using my phone even harder.  The entire process often hinders my continuous deep thought and can lead to me getting distracted or forgetting 
what I was really getting to.  During one of these recent walks it occured to me that the ideal solution to this problem is an application that 
allowed me to converse with GPT(or LLM of choice) without having to type and then read paragraphs of text on my phone while walking while outside.


## Functionality
- Swift UI for iOS
- Python Flask for server
- Flask server.py also contains the GPT API integration


## Use
- Due to the Apple dictatorship hosting publicly will take a while
-
